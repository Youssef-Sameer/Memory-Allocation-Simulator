The Memory Allocation Simulator project in C++ aims to create a tool that visualizes memory allocation algorithms such as first fit, best fit, and worst fit, allowing users to understand their workings. It will simulate the allocation and deallocation of memory blocks for processes, providing a platform for users to interactively explore different allocation strategies, analyze performance metrics, and gain insights into memory management concepts. Through a user-friendly interface and comprehensive documentation, this project seeks to facilitate learning and experimentation in memory management for both students and professionals.
